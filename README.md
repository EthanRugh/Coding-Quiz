# Coding Quiz

## An application which displays questions about javascript. Users may test their knowledge of code with five dynamically generated questions. The application also generates buttons that, when clicked, will load the next question, deduct time from your timer if the answer is wrong, or add a point to your score if the answer is correct. This project has made me much better at dynamically generating elements using javascript (a skill i'm sure will prove useful later). It has also shown me just how "finicky" the language can be at times. Thanks for your consideration, and happy coding.
